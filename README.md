# Connect4AI
Recursively goes through each combination of the Connect 4 Board to find the best move. Uses a negamax algorithm optimized with alpha-beta pruning and transposition tables. The program also utilizes bitwise operations to make moves and check winning positions in O(1) time. If the AI goes first it will win no matter what as Connect 4 is not a zero-sum game.
